# Tailor
Tailor is a resume creation app that uses OpenAI's state of the art LLM API to help you design the perfect resume for your dream job! With Tailor, you can create an account, populate your profile with your job experience, education, and personal information, and watch AI make a tailor-made resume for any job. We used the OpenAI API to match job experiences to job postings provided by the user and generate a new resume based on the results. 

## Progress
We were able to create the back-end logic and services for Tailor, i.e. the job post scraping and the resume matching, but were unable to complete the UI interface for the service.
